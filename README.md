# coco-process
The MSCOCO dataset has 81 categories of objects including 21 categories of pascal voc dataset.
We often do the pretrain including detection and segmentation on coco dataset and then train on the pascal voc 
so we need to ignore other 60 categories for voc detection and segmentation annotations.This project aims to finish the process.
